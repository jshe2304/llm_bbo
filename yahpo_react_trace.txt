**1.** We know only that the validation cross‑entropy \(F\) is a noisy, highly non‑convex function of eight mixed‑type hyperparameters, with no guaranteed smoothness or monotonicity across their ranges.  

**2.** We need information about which regions of each hyperparameter’s domain have the strongest influence on reducing \(F\) (i.e., sensitivity) and whether any obvious interactions (e.g., between learning‑rate and batch‑size or depth and units) exist.  

**3.** We should evaluate a point near the centre of the search space (e.g., batch = 256, epoch = 26, lr ≈ 0.025, dropout ≈ 0.5, units ≈ 544, momentum ≈ 0.5, layers = 3, weight_decay ≈ 0.005) to obtain a baseline that is simultaneously informative about all dimensions before committing evaluations to more extreme or targeted regions.

1. From the single evaluation we only know a local loss value, so the validation cross‑entropy landscape appears smooth but highly non‑linear with many interacting hyper‑parameters.  
2. We need to learn which dimensions have the strongest effect on performance and whether there are beneficial trade‑offs (e.g., larger batch size vs. higher learning rate).  
3. The next sample should lie at the center of the remaining feasible region while varying a few key parameters (e.g., a moderate batch size, a slightly higher learning rate, and a mid‑range dropout) to capture gradient‑like information across the most uncertain dimensions.

1. We know that the validation cross‑entropy is a noisy, non‑convex function of the hyperparameters, with strong sensitivity to learning‑rate‑related parameters and network capacity.  
2. We need to gather information about how learning‑rate interacts with weight‑decay and how model size (num_layers × max_units) and dropout affect performance in the mid‑range of the search space.  
3. Thus we should evaluate a point in the interior of the domain with a modest learning‑rate (≈0.01), low‑to‑moderate weight‑decay (≈0.001), medium batch size (≈128), a balanced architecture (e.g., 3 layers, 512 units) and dropout around 0.3‑0.5.

1. From the three trials we see that moderate batch sizes, learning rates around 0.01–0.05, and dropout ≈ 0.4–0.5 with 3–4 layers tend to give lower cross‑entropy, suggesting a relatively smooth, locally convex region but with strong interactions between depth, units, and regularization.  
2. We need to clarify how the number of layers and the maximum hidden units trade off against each other and how sensitive the optimum is to learning‑rate and momentum when dropout and weight decay are varied.  
3. Therefore, the next evaluation should focus on a grid‑like corner of the space: keep batch = 256, epochs ≈ 30, dropout ≈ 0.4, weight‑decay ≈ 0.005, but test extremes of num_layers (1 vs 5) combined with high max_units (1024) and a lower learning‑rate (≈ 0.005) while also probing a higher momentum (≈ 0.8) to map those interactions.

**1.** The single evaluated point (batch 256, epochs 30, LR 0.005, dropout 0.4, units 1024, momentum 0.8, layers 5, weight‑decay 0.005) gives a relatively high validation loss (≈0.33), suggesting that such an aggressive combination (large network, high dropout, high momentum) is not optimal.  

**2.** We need to determine whether reducing model capacity (fewer layers/units), lowering dropout, and using a smaller learning rate improve the loss, and also explore the effect of batch size and weight decay.  

**3.** A promising region is moderate model size (e.g., 2–3 layers, 256–512 units), low dropout (≈0.1–0.2), a smaller learning rate (≈1e‑3), and a batch size around 128‑256; we should evaluate a point in that neighborhood.

1. From the two evaluations we see that a moderate batch size (≈256), higher learning rates (≈0.005–0.01) and deeper networks with many units tend to give lower cross‑entropy, while very low learning rates and small models perform worse.  
2. We still need to determine the optimal trade‑off among the remaining continuous hyperparameters (max_dropout, momentum, weight_decay) and whether a slightly smaller batch size or fewer epochs can further improve validation loss.  
3. The next point should therefore probe a region with batch_size around 200, epoch ≈30–35, a modest dropout (≈0.2), momentum near 0.6, weight_decay near 0.001, and keep learning_rate around 0.005–0.01 with max_units ≈800 and num_layers ≈4.

**1. What we know:**  
The best results so far (≈ 0.32 CE) come from large models (max_units ≈ 1024, num_layers ≈ 5) trained with moderate‑high dropout (≈ 0.4), a relatively low learning rate (≈ 0.005–0.008), high momentum (0.8) and modest weight decay (≈ 0.005–0.01). Increasing batch size to 256 – 512 and epochs to 40 +  also helps.

**2. What we need:**  
We still do not know how sensitive the optimum is to (i) batch size beyond 256, (ii) learning‑rate finer tuning below 0.005, and (iii) very small weight‑decay values (≈ 10⁻⁵ – 10⁻³). Exploring these three dimensions will tell whether we can push the validation loss below 0.32.

**3. Where to gather it:**  
Pick a point that keeps the proven good settings (max_units = 1024, num_layers = 5, dropout = 0.4, momentum = 0.8) and varies the three uncertain hyper‑parameters: use the maximum batch size (512), a slightly lower learning rate (0.003), and a smaller weight decay (0.001).

**1. What we know about the structure of F?**  
The validation loss is lowest (≈ 0.321) for large models (max_units ≈ 1024, num_layers ≈ 5) trained with moderate batch size (≈ 256), relatively high momentum (≈ 0.8), dropout around 0.4, and a learning rate near 0.005; increasing epochs from 30 to 40 improves the loss.

**2. What information do we need to gather?**  
We need to determine whether small adjustments around this promising region (especially epoch count, learning‑rate, dropout, and weight‑decay) can push the loss lower, and whether the current batch‑size and momentum are near‑optimal or if modest changes help.

**3. Where in the parameter space should we gather that information?**  
We should probe a tight neighbourhood of the best point [256, 40, 0.005, 0.4, 1024, 0.8, 5, 0.005], varying the most sensitive continuous parameters (epoch, learning‑rate, dropout, weight‑decay) while keeping the discrete choices (batch_size, max_units, momentum, num_layers) fixed. This will let us map the local landscape and locate a potential minimum.

2. We still need finer information about how sensitive the loss is to small variations in learning‑rate, dropout, and batch‑size around this promising region, and whether a slightly larger batch or a few more epochs can further improve performance.  

3.

**Reasoning**  
1. The loss is lowest for large networks (max_units = 1024, num_layers = 5) with high momentum (≈0.85‑0.9), minimal weight decay (1e‑5), dropout around 0.35‑0.38, learning‑rate ≈ 0.004‑0.006, epochs ≈ 44‑48 and batch sizes in the 256‑320 range.  
2. We need finer detail around this promising region to pinpoint the exact combination of batch size, learning‑rate, dropout and momentum that yields the minimum.  
3. Thus we should evaluate a point near the current best ([320, 48, 0.005, 0.38, 1024, 0.85, 5, 1e‑5]) but vary the uncertain parameters slightly (batch size, lr, dropout, momentum).

1. F is lowest (≈0.30) when the network is deep (5 layers), uses the maximum units (1024), high momentum (≈0.9), minimum weight‑decay, moderate batch size (≈320) and relatively high dropout (≈0.35‑0.38) with a learning rate around 0.006.  
2. We need to test whether a slightly smaller learning rate and a slightly lower dropout improve the validation loss further, while keeping the other good settings fixed.  
3. We should evaluate near the current best point, varying only learning rate and dropout (e.g., learning rate ≈ 0.0058, dropout ≈ 0.36) with batch = 320, epochs = 48, max_units = 1024, momentum = 0.9, num_layers = 5, weight_decay = 1e‑05.

1. The validation cross‑entropy drops sharply when the network is wide (≈1024 units), deep (5 layers), uses moderate‑to‑high dropout (≈0.36‑0.38) and a learning rate around 0.005‑0.006, while very low weight decay (≈1e‑5) is beneficial; however, the exact trade‑off between batch size, epochs, momentum, and learning‑rate nuances is still unclear.  
2. We need to determine how sensitive the loss is to the remaining degrees of freedom—especially batch size, number of epochs, and momentum—so we can pinpoint an optimal combination that further reduces the loss beyond the current best (~0.298).  
3. Evaluate a point that keeps the promising architecture (batch‑size‑≈320, epochs‑≈45‑48, learning‑rate‑≈0.0055, dropout‑≈0.37, units‑1024, layers‑5, weight‑decay‑1e‑5) while varying momentum (e.g., 0.75 vs 0.85) and batch size (e.g., 256 vs 384) to see which direction improves the loss.

**Reasoning**  
1. **Structure of F**: The lowest cross‑entropy values cluster around a high‑capacity setting – max units = 1024, num_layers = 5, epoch ≈ 48‑52, batch ≈ 320‑384, learning_rate ≈ 0.005‑0.006, dropout ≈ 0.35‑0.38, momentum ≈ 0.85‑0.90, and the smallest allowed weight_decay = 1e‑05. Small variations in these ranges produce differences of only a few hundredths, indicating a relatively flat basin with a likely optimum near the centre of this region.  

2. **Information needed**: We need to pinpoint whether the optimum lies at the edge of any of these dimensions (e.g., larger batch, higher epoch, slightly lower learning‑rate, or a different momentum) or whether we have already saturated performance.  

3. **Where to sample**: Sample a point that moves one step toward the centre of the promising basin while testing a boundary that has not yet been explored: increase epoch to the maximum (52) and try a slightly lower learning‑rate (0.0055) with a modestly larger batch (384) and the same optimal‑so‑far dropout, momentum, and weight‑decay.

**1. What we know about F**  
- The lowest loss so far is **≈ 0.298** at  
  `batch=320, epoch=48, lr=0.0058, dropout=0.36, units=1024, momentum=0.85, layers=5, wd=1e‑05`.  
- Loss is comparatively low when the network is deep (5 layers), very wide (1024 units), trained for many epochs (≈ 45‑48), and uses a *small* learning‑rate (≈ 0.005‑0.006) with *low* dropout (≈ 0.35‑0.38) and *low* weight‑decay (1e‑05).  
- Slight variations around these values (e.g., dropout 0.38, lr 0.006) give similar but marginally higher losses, suggesting a narrow optimum region.

**2. What we need**  
- Determine whether the optimum lies a bit **lower** in dropout (≈ 0.30‑0.34) or **higher** in learning‑rate (≈ 0.006‑0.008) while keeping the other good settings.  
- Verify if a slightly **smaller batch size** (256) or a **few fewer epochs** (44‑46) can improve generalisation.  
- Confirm the effect of a **higher momentum** (≈ 0.90) versus the current 0.85.

**3. Where to sample (3 evaluations left)**  

| Eval | batch_size | epoch | learning_rate | max_dropout | max_units | momentum | num_layers | weight_decay |
|------|------------|-------|----------------|-------------|-----------|----------|------------|--------------|
| 1 | **256** | 46 | **0.0045** | **0.33** | 1024 | 0.90 | 5 | 1e‑05 |
| 2 | **320** | 44 | **0.0065** | **0.35** | 1024 | 0.85 | 5 | 1e‑05 |
| 3 | **384** | 48 | **0.0050** | **0.32** | 1024 | 0.88 | 5 | 1e‑05 |

These points explore (a) lower dropout & lower LR with a smaller batch, (b) slightly higher LR and slightly fewer epochs, and (c) a slightly larger batch with very low dropout. They stay within the promising region while probing the three remaining degrees of freedom.

1. **What we know:** The validation loss is lowest (≈0.298) for a large network (1024 units, 5 layers) with a relatively high momentum (0.9), very small weight‑decay, batch size ≈320, many epochs (48), a modest learning‑rate around 0.0058, and dropout in the mid‑30 % range; moving away from these values (e.g., changing batch size, reducing momentum, increasing dropout) quickly degrades performance.  

2. **What we need:** We must determine whether the current optimum is a true minimum or if a slight adjustment of the learning‑rate, dropout, or number of epochs can push the loss further down, while confirming that the other hyper‑parameters (batch size, momentum, weight‑decay) are already near their best values.  

3. **Where to gather it:** Use the remaining two evaluations to (a) fine‑tune the learning‑rate and dropout together around the current optimum—e.g., try lr ≈ 0.0054 with dropout ≈ 0.34 and (b) test a slightly longer training regime—e.g., lr ≈ 0.0062, dropout ≈ 0.38, and epochs = 52—keeping batch = 320, units = 1024, layers = 5, momentum = 0.9, and weight‑decay = 1e‑05.
