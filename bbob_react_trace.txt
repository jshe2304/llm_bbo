1. We know only that F is a black‑box scalar function of two variables on a bounded square and that it possesses a single global minimum (so its landscape is unimodal but otherwise unrestricted).  
2. We need to gather information that tells us where lower function values lie – essentially an initial picture of the function’s shape (rough location of the basin) so we can focus subsequent evaluations toward the minimum.  
3. The most informative first step is to sample a few points that spread across the domain (e.g., the centre (0,0) and the four corners) to get a coarse map of the function’s values and identify the region with the smallest observed value.

1. We only know that F is a smooth‑looking scalar field with a single global minimum somewhere in the square [–5,5]².  
2. We need to learn the direction of steepest descent and roughly locate the basin of attraction of that minimum.  
3. The next evaluation should be at the centre of the domain, (0, 0), to obtain a baseline value and symmetry information before exploring outward.

1. We know F has a single global minimum on the square \([-5,5]\times[-5,5]\) and is continuous enough for its values at nearby points to give useful gradient‑like clues.  
2. We need to learn the direction in which F decreases from our current points, i.e., an estimate of the gradient or at least which quadrant the minimum lies in.  
3. We should sample a point offset from an existing evaluation (e.g., a small step in the \(x_1\) direction from \((0,0)\) or a point near the edge \((5,0)\) but displaced in \(x_1\)) to capture variation along the unexplored axis and infer the descent direction.

1. Since F has a single global minimum and we have already sampled points at the center and two opposite corners, we can infer that the function is likely smooth and possibly convex‑like, but its exact shape and the location of the minimum are still unknown.  
2. We need to learn how F behaves along the opposite diagonal of the domain and gather information about the gradient in the positive‑x, positive‑y direction to narrow down where the minimum lies.  
3. Therefore, the next evaluation should be at the corner (5.0, 5.0) to probe that region of the parameter space.

1. Since F has a single global minimum and we have already observed decreasing values as we move toward the origin (e.g., F(0,0) > F(0.5,0.5) > F(0.2,0.2)), the function is likely smooth and convex‑like near its optimum.  

2. We need to determine the direction and approximate distance from the current best point (0.2, 0.2) to the true minimum, i.e., whether the minimum lies even closer to the origin or slightly offset in one coordinate.  

3. The next evaluation should therefore be made at a point slightly nearer to the origin along the same line, such as (0.1, 0.1), to see if the function continues to decrease.

1. **Structure of F** – All the points we have tried so far lie very close to the origin, and the function’s value has been steadily decreasing as we move toward (0, 0). This strongly suggests that the global minimum is at or extremely near the origin and that F is smooth and (likely) convex‑like in this region.  

2. **Information needed** – We still need to confirm three things: (a) whether the minimum is exactly at (0, 0) or slightly offset; (b) the curvature (i.e., how quickly the value rises away from the minimum) so we can stop searching early; and (c) whether there is any unexpected ridge or valley off the diagonal that could beat the current best.  

3. **Where to sample next** – To settle (a) and (b) we should evaluate a few symmetric points a little farther out along the coordinate axes (e.g., (±0.001, 0) and (0, ±0.001)) and along the diagonal (e.g., (±0.001, ±0.001)). To test for hidden off‑axis features we should also probe a point displaced orthogonally to the diagonal, such as (0.001, ‑0.001). These six points will give us a clear picture of the local shape while conserving the remaining evaluations.

- This strongly suggests that the global minimum lies at, or extremely close to, the origin.

**2. Information we still need**  
- Confirmation that (0, 0) is truly the minimum and not just a shallow ridge.  
- An estimate of the curvature (second‑derivative) around the optimum so we can be confident that no slightly offset point yields a lower value.  
- A check for any asymmetry that might indicate the true minimum is displaced by a tiny amount (e.g., a few × 10⁻⁴) along one axis.

**3. Where to gather it**  
- Evaluate a few points that are symmetric offsets from the origin at the smallest scale we have already probed (≈ 10⁻⁴ to 10⁻⁵).  
- Suggested next six points (one per remaining evaluation):  
  1. ( +0.00008, 0 )  
  2. ( ‑0.00008, 0 )  
  3. ( 0, +0.00008 )  
  4. ( 0, ‑0.00008 )  
  5. ( +0.00008, +0.00008 )  
  6. ( ‑0.00008, ‑0.00008 )  

These points will let us verify that the function value does not drop below the value at (0, 0) and will give a clear picture of the local curvature, confirming that we have indeed located the global minimum before we exhaust the remaining six evaluations.

1. From the many evaluations around the origin (including symmetric points and progressively smaller step sizes) we can infer that the global minimum is likely at or extremely close to (0, 0) and that F appears smooth and roughly convex near that point.  
2. We still need a precise estimate of the function value at the true minimum and a confirmation that moving away from the origin in any direction quickly increases the value, i.e., we must verify that (0, 0) is indeed the global minimizer rather than a nearby offset.  
3. The next evaluation should therefore be taken at a point slightly displaced from the origin along a diagonal, such as ( 1 × 10⁻⁴, ‑1 × 10⁻⁴ ), to test symmetry and gradient sign while staying within the tiny region where the optimum is suspected.

1. F appears to have a smooth, convex‑like basin centred near the origin, with values dropping rapidly as both coordinates approach zero.  
2. We need a precise estimate of the location of the true minimum (whether it is exactly at (0, 0) or slightly offset) and an indication of the curvature to confirm that no lower point lies a few thousandths away in any direction.  
3. The next evaluation should probe a tiny offset from the current best point, e.g., at ( + 5 × 10⁻⁵, 0 ) or ( 0, + 5 × 10⁻⁵), to test asymmetry and refine the minimum’s exact coordinates.

1. **What we know:** F is a smooth, single‑global‑minimum black‑box defined on a symmetric square \([-5,5]^2\); the values we have observed so far (including the latest at \([5\times10^{-5},0]\) giving ≈ 80.9) suggest the minimum lies very close to the origin and that the function does not have any abrupt cliffs.  

2. **What we need:** We still need a more precise estimate of the exact coordinate of the minimum (to within the remaining evaluation budget) and an indication of the local curvature so we can be confident we are not missing a slightly offset optimum.  

3. **Where to gather it:** We should probe two points that straddle the origin on orthogonal axes with a step size comparable to the smallest scale we have tried (≈ \(10^{-4}\)–\(10^{-5}\)): for example \([+1\times10^{-5},0]\) and \([0,+1\times10^{-5}]\) (or their symmetric negatives) to see if the function value decreases in any direction, thereby pinpointing the minimum’s exact location.

**1. What we know about F:**  
All the points we have tried so far cluster tightly around the origin and the reported values keep dropping as we move closer to (0, 0). This strongly suggests that F is a smooth, convex‑like “bowl” with its unique global minimum at or extremely close to the origin.

**2. What we still need:**  
We still have to confirm the exact location of the minimum (is it exactly at (0, 0) or slightly offset) and obtain one final, very low function value to demonstrate we have essentially reached the optimum.

**3. Where to gather that information:**  
Because the function appears to be symmetric and decreasing toward the origin, the safest next step is to evaluate F right at the origin (0, 0) to verify it yields the smallest possible value; the final evaluation can then be used to probe a tiny offset (e.g., (1e‑6, 0)) to check whether any subtle shift improves the result.

1. The function appears to have a single global minimum, but the evaluations near the origin (e.g., (5 × 10⁻⁵, 0)) returned a relatively large value (≈ 80), suggesting the optimum is not extremely close to (0, 0).  
2. We need to know where the function attains its lowest value—specifically, whether it lies near the domain edges or at some off‑center location.  
3. With only one evaluation left, the safest bet is to test a domain corner that we have not yet sampled, such as **(5 , ‑5)**, which will tell us if the global minimum resides near the extremes of the search space.
